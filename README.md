# Apple sales reports

Welcome,  

This program provides various options for performing calculations and obtaining data. Users can choose between monthly, weekly, and daily calculations, and access a range of specific metrics related to sales and performance. Overall, it is a versatile tool for analyzing and calculating various aspects of data and performance.

The "Apple sales" data is stored in Google Sheet, which is used as a database, and using Google's APIs for Gdrive and Google sheets, relevant data is extracted from it and presented to the user based on their choice of calculations.
